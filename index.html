                        <h2>The History of Pakistani Music</h2>
                        <p>
                            The music of Pakistan has deep roots that go back centuries, drawing influences from South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Following the partition in 1947, Pakistan developed its distinct musical identity. Early pioneers, such as Noor Jehan and Ahmed Rushdi, dominated the playback singing scene in films. Meanwhile, classical traditions continued to thrive with maestros like Roshan Ara Begum and Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan.

During this era, artists like Mehdi Hassan (the king of ghazals) and Farida Khanum gained immense popularity. The 1980s and 90s introduced modern pop and rock to the country, with bands like Vital Signs and Junoon revolutionizing the music industry, blending Western influences with Eastern roots.
